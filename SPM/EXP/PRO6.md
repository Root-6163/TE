## 🧠 **Step 1: Recall Key EVA Formulas**

| Parameter                            | Formula               | Meaning                                   |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **PV (Planned Value)**               | BAC × (% time passed) | Work that *should* have been done         |
| **EV (Earned Value)**                | –                     | Work *actually completed* (given)         |
| **AC (Actual Cost)**                 | –                     | Cost *actually spent* (given)             |
| **SPI (Schedule Performance Index)** | EV / PV               | Schedule efficiency                       |
| **CPI (Cost Performance Index)**     | EV / AC               | Cost efficiency                           |
| **EAC (Estimate at Completion)**     | BAC / (CPI × SPI)     | Estimated final cost                      |
| **VAC (Variance at Completion)**     | BAC - EAC             | Budget variance (positive = under budget) |

## 🧮 **Step 2: Compute EVA Metrics**

### 1️⃣ Planned Value (PV)

Since the project is **halfway (5 months of 10)**:

[
PV = 50000000 × \frac{5}{10} = 25000000
]

✅ **PV = ₹2,50,00,000**

---

### 2️⃣ Given Values:

* **EV = ₹2,55,00,000**
* **AC = ₹2,20,00,000**

---

### 3️⃣ SPI (Schedule Performance Index)

[
SPI = \frac{EV}{PV} = \frac{25500000}{25000000} = 1.02
]

✅ **SPI = 1.02 → Slightly ahead of schedule**

---

### 4️⃣ CPI (Cost Performance Index)

[
CPI = \frac{EV}{AC} = \frac{25500000}{22000000} = 1.159
]

✅ **CPI = 1.16 → Cost-efficient (less spending per unit of work)**

---

### 5️⃣ EAC (Estimate at Completion)

[
EAC = \frac{BAC}{CPI × SPI} = \frac{50000000}{(1.159 × 1.02)} = \frac{50000000}{1.182} = 42,310,000
]

✅ **EAC ≈ ₹4,23,10,000**

---

### 6️⃣ VAC (Variance at Completion)

[
VAC = BAC - EAC = 50000000 - 42310000 = 7,690,000
]

✅ **VAC = +₹7,69,000 → Project expected to finish under budget**

---

## 📊 **Step 3: Interpretation (for Viva)**

| Metric              | Value                                       | Interpretation |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| **SPI = 1.02**      | Slightly ahead of schedule                  |                |
| **CPI = 1.16**      | Cost-efficient (spending less than planned) |                |
| **EAC = ₹4.23 Cr**  | Estimated total cost at completion          |                |
| **VAC = +₹0.77 Cr** | Project will save approximately ₹77 lakh    |                |

✅ **Conclusion:**
The project is both **ahead of schedule and under budget** — this indicates excellent project performance and resource utilization.

## 📈 **Step 4: Line Chart (For EdrawMax)**

### **Title:**

📊 “EVA Analysis – Wind Power Plant Project”

### **X-Axis:**

Project Metrics (PV, EV, AC, BAC, EAC)

### **Y-Axis:**

Cost (in ₹)

### **Data Table for Line Chart:**

| Metric | Cost (₹)   |
| ------ | ---------- |
| PV     | 25,000,000 |
| EV     | 25,500,000 |
| AC     | 22,000,000 |
| BAC    | 50,000,000 |
| EAC    | 42,310,000 |

### **Instructions to Draw in EdrawMax:**

1. Open **EdrawMax → Charts → Line Chart**
2. Click **“Edit Data” → Add the 5 data points** above
3. Label **X-axis** as “Project Performance Metrics”
4. Label **Y-axis** as “Cost (₹)”
5. Use:

   * **Blue line** for *planned values (PV, BAC)*
   * **Green line** for *actual performance (EV, AC, EAC)*
6. Add data labels to each point for clarity
7. Add annotations:

   * “SPI > 1 → Ahead of Schedule”
   * “CPI > 1 → Under Budget”

## 🗣️ **Viva-Ready Explanation**

> “For the wind power plant project, we analyzed cost performance using the Earned Value Analysis method.
> The project was halfway (5 months) with EV = ₹2.55 Cr and AC = ₹2.20 Cr.
> From the calculations, CPI = 1.16 and SPI = 1.02.
> The EAC = ₹4.23 Cr, which is less than the BAC = ₹5 Cr, so the project is **ahead of schedule and under budget**.
> The line chart in EdrawMax compares planned vs. actual cost and shows cost efficiency.”

Would you like me to give you the **EdrawMax data table in CSV format** (so you can directly import it and auto-generate the line chart)?
It will take 5 seconds to create and you won’t need to manually enter values.
