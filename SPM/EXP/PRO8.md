Here’s how your **line chart for SPM Experiment 8 (Earned Value Analysis)** looks 👆

### 📊 Interpretation:

* **PV (Planned Value): ₹10,000** — The value of work planned to be completed.
* **EV (Earned Value): ₹5,000** — The value of work actually completed.
* **AC (Actual Cost): ₹10,000** — The cost incurred so far.
* **BAC (Budget at Completion): ₹20,000** — The total project budget.
* **EAC (Estimate at Completion): ₹22,000** — The expected total cost at completion (project over budget).

### 🔍 EVA Analysis Summary:

| Metric  | Meaning                | Value (₹) |
| :------ | :--------------------- | --------: |
| **PV**  | Planned value          |    10,000 |
| **EV**  | Earned value           |     5,000 |
| **AC**  | Actual cost            |    10,000 |
| **BAC** | Budget at completion   |    20,000 |
| **EAC** | Estimate at completion |    22,000 |

**CPI (Cost Performance Index) = EV / AC = 0.5** → Over budget
**SPI (Schedule Performance Index) = EV / PV = 0.5** → Behind schedule

✅ This is exactly the type of line chart you can recreate in **EdrawMax**:

* Use **“Line Chart”** from the chart templates.
* Add X-axis labels as `PV, EV, AC, BAC, EAC`.
* Plot the corresponding values on the Y-axis (₹).
