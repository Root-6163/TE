Excellent 👍 — this is a **core SPPU SPM practical** that tests your understanding of **Gantt Chart**, **Earned Value Analysis (EVA)**, and **project tracking**.

Let’s go step-by-step so you can **create this perfectly in EdrawMax** and also **explain it clearly during your viva**.

## 🧾 **Experiment Title**

> **Prepare a Gantt Chart showing the percentage completion of tasks with current task status for Online Medicine Delivery System.
> Assume suitable data and calculate CPI and SPI using Earned Value Analysis (EVA) method.**

---

## 🧠 **Objective**

To represent the progress of various project tasks using a **Gantt Chart** and to evaluate project performance using **Earned Value Analysis (EVA)** parameters such as:

* **CPI (Cost Performance Index)**
* **SPI (Schedule Performance Index)**

### 📋 Main Tasks (Assumed)

| Task ID | Task Name              | Planned Duration (Days) | Actual Duration (Days) | Planned Cost (₹) | Actual Cost (₹) | % Work Completed |

| T1      | Requirements Gathering | 5                       | 5                      | 10,000           | 10,000          | 100%             |

## 📊 **Step 1: Gantt Chart in EdrawMax**

### ➤ What to show:

* Task names (T1–T5)
* Planned vs Actual timelines
* Progress (% Completion)
* Current status (color coding)

### ➤ In EdrawMax:

1. Go to **Project Management → Gantt Chart**.
2. Add tasks as rows (T1–T5).
3. Enter **start date**, **duration**, and **% complete** (see table above).
4. Use colors:

   * 🟩 Completed → Green
   * 🟨 In progress → Yellow
   * 🟥 Delayed → Red
5. Add a progress bar for each task showing its completion.

✅ **Title:**
“Gantt Chart for Online Medicine Delivery System – Task Progress and Status”

---

## ⚙️ **Step 2: Earned Value Analysis (EVA)**

We’ll calculate the three key values:

### **1️⃣ PV – Planned Value**

→ Budgeted cost of work *scheduled* till date.

### **2️⃣ EV – Earned Value**

→ Budgeted cost of work *performed* till date.
Formula:

> EV = (Planned Cost × % Completed)

### **3️⃣ AC – Actual Cost**

→ Actual cost incurred till date.

---

### 🧮 **Calculations**

| Task      | Planned Cost (PV) | % Completed | EV (Earned Value) | Actual Cost (AC) |
| --------- | ----------------- | ----------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| T1        | 10,000            | 100%        | 10,000            | 10,000           |
| T2        | 15,000            | 100%        | 15,000            | 17,000           |
| T3        | 30,000            | 80%         | 24,000            | 35,000           |
| T4        | 20,000            | 70%         | 14,000            | 23,000           |
| T5        | 15,000            | 30%         | 4,500             | 5,000            |
| **Total** | **90,000**        |             | **67,500 (EV)**   | **90,000 (AC)**  |

---

### **Formulas:**

[
CPI = \frac{EV}{AC}
]

[
SPI = \frac{EV}{PV}
]

---

### **Calculations:**

* **CPI = 67,500 / 90,000 = 0.75**
* **SPI = 67,500 / 90,000 = 0.75**

## 📈 **Interpretation**

| Index          | Value | Meaning                                           |
| -------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **CPI = 0.75** | < 1   | Project is **over budget** (cost overrun)         |
| **SPI = 0.75** | < 1   | Project is **behind schedule** (delayed progress) |

✅ If CPI > 1 → under budget
✅ If SPI > 1 → ahead of schedule

## 🗣️ **Sample Viva Explanation**

> “This Gantt Chart represents the Online Medicine Delivery Management System project.
> Each task shows planned and actual progress with percentage completion.
> Using Earned Value Analysis, we calculated:
>
> * Earned Value (EV) = ₹67,500
> * Actual Cost (AC) = ₹90,000
> * Planned Value (PV) = ₹90,000
> * CPI = 0.75 → Project is cost overrun
> * SPI = 0.75 → Project is delayed
>
> Hence, the project requires better cost control and scheduling management.”

## 🧩 **Tips for EdrawMax Practical**

✅ Use **different colors** for task progress (Green/Yellow/Red).
✅ Add a **timeline bar** across the top.
✅ Label **% complete** beside each task bar.
✅ Include a **legend** (Completed / In-progress / Delayed).
✅ Title your chart clearly.
✅ Show the CPI and SPI calculations in a separate text box at the bottom.
