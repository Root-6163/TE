Perfect 👏 This question is an **Earned Value Analysis (EVA)** continuation (Experiment No. 5 type), focusing on **forecasting project cost and performance** using **EAC** and **VAC** when both **CPI** and **SPI** influence the project.

Let’s go step-by-step so you can **understand**, **explain during viva**, and then **draw the line chart in EdrawMax** easily.

## 🧾 **Question**

> Compute **Estimate at Completion (EAC)** and **Variance at Completion (VAC)**
> if both **SPI** and **CPI** influence the project work,
> given:
>
> * **BAC (Budget at Completion)** = ₹22,000
> * **EV (Earned Value)** = ₹13,000
> * **PV (Planned Value)** = ₹14,000
> * **AC (Actual Cost)** = ₹15,000

## 🧠 **Step 1: Recall EVA Key Formulas**

| Parameter                          | Formula           | Meaning                                                    |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CPI**                            | EV / AC           | Cost Performance Index                                     |
| **SPI**                            | EV / PV           | Schedule Performance Index                                 |
| **EAC** (Both SPI & CPI influence) | BAC / (CPI × SPI) | New estimated cost of project                              |
| **VAC**                            | BAC - EAC         | Variance at Completion (expected cost overrun or underrun) |

---

## 🧮 **Step 2: Calculate CPI and SPI**

[
CPI = \frac{EV}{AC} = \frac{13000}{15000} = 0.8667
]

[
SPI = \frac{EV}{PV} = \frac{13000}{14000} = 0.9286
]

---

## ⚙️ **Step 3: Compute EAC (when both CPI and SPI influence)**

[
EAC = \frac{BAC}{(CPI \times SPI)}
]

[
EAC = \frac{22000}{(0.8667 \times 0.9286)} = \frac{22000}{0.8056} = 27,300.37
]

✅ **EAC ≈ ₹27,300**

---

## ⚙️ **Step 4: Compute VAC**

[
VAC = BAC - EAC = 22000 - 27300 = -5300
]

✅ **VAC = -₹5,300 (Cost Overrun Expected)**

---

## 📊 **Step 5: Interpretation (Viva Point)**

| Term              | Value                                                    | Meaning |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| **CPI = 0.87**    | Project is spending more than planned (cost inefficient) |         |
| **SPI = 0.93**    | Project progress is slightly behind schedule             |         |
| **EAC = ₹27,300** | Estimated final cost will exceed the original budget     |         |
| **VAC = -₹5,300** | Project will exceed budget by ₹5,300                     |         |

✅ **Conclusion:** The project is behind schedule and over budget. Both time and cost performance are affecting completion.

## 📈 **Step 6: Line Chart for EdrawMax**

### 🔹 Chart Title:

> *"EVA Metrics for Online Medicine Delivery System"*

### 🔹 X-Axis:

* Metrics: PV, EV, AC, BAC, EAC

### 🔹 Y-Axis:

* Cost (in ₹)

### 🔹 Data Table for Chart:

| Parameter | Cost (₹) |
| --------- | -------- |
| PV        | 14,000   |
| EV        | 13,000   |
| AC        | 15,000   |
| BAC       | 22,000   |
| EAC       | 27,300   |

### 🧭 How to Draw in **EdrawMax**:

1. Open **EdrawMax → Charts → Line Chart**.
2. Add the 5 data points (PV, EV, AC, BAC, EAC).
3. Label X-axis with names and Y-axis with cost values.
4. Add data labels for each point.
5. Use a **different color line** for "Actual" and "Estimated" values (e.g., blue for PV/EV/AC, red for BAC/EAC).
6. Title the chart:

   > “Line Chart: Cost Performance (Planned vs Actual vs Estimate)”

✅ **Optional:** Add annotation text boxes like:

* “Project cost trend increasing”
* “EAC > BAC → Overrun risk”

## 🗣️ **Viva Explanation Example**

> “In this experiment, I evaluated the project’s financial performance using Earned Value Analysis.
> Given BAC = ₹22,000, EV = ₹13,000, PV = ₹14,000, and AC = ₹15,000:
>
> * CPI = 0.87 and SPI = 0.93 indicate cost and schedule inefficiency.
> * Using both SPI and CPI influence, EAC = 27,300 and VAC = -5,300.
>   This means the project will likely finish over budget by ₹5,300.
>   The line chart shows how estimated completion cost (EAC) exceeds planned budget (BAC).”
