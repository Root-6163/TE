## ⚙️ Step-by-Step in **EdrawMax**

### 🟢 1. **Line Chart (for cost over time)**

#### ➤ What to represent:

Planned vs Actual Project Cost over different development weeks.

#### ➤ Sample Data:

| Week   | Planned Cost (₹) | Actual Cost (₹) |
| ------ | ---------------- | --------------- |
| Week 1 | 10,000           | 12,000          |
| Week 2 | 20,000           | 22,000          |
| Week 3 | 35,000           | 38,000          |
| Week 4 | 45,000           | 50,000          |
| Week 5 | 55,000           | 60,000          |

#### ➤ In EdrawMax:

1. Go to **Insert → Chart → Line Chart**.
2. Right-click → **Edit Data**.
3. Enter the above table.
4. Label the axes:

   * X-axis → “Time (Weeks)”
   * Y-axis → “Project Cost (₹)”
5. Add two lines:

   * Blue → “Planned Cost”
   * Red → “Actual Cost”
6. Title:
   **“Planned vs Actual Project Cost – Online Medicine Delivery System”**

### 🔵 2. **Bar Chart (for module comparison)**

#### ➤ What to represent:

Compare **Planned vs Actual Cost** OR **Resources per module**.

#### ➤ In EdrawMax:

1. Go to **Insert → Chart → Bar Chart**.
2. Right-click → **Edit Data**.
3. Enter:

| Module          | Planned Cost | Actual Cost |
| --------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| UI Design       | 20           | 25          |
| Database        | 30           | 35          |

## 🗣️ Viva Explanation (Sample Answer)

> “Sir/Ma’am, this project represents an Online Medicine Delivery Management System.
> The **Line Chart** compares the *planned and actual project cost* across development weeks, showing that actual cost slightly exceeded the planned budget due to extra resources.
> The **Bar Chart** compares *planned vs actual cost per module*, which helps identify which module consumed more cost or time.
> This helps project managers control and analyze performance efficiently.”

---

## 💡 Pro Tips for Practical:

✅ Use **contrasting colors** (Planned = Blue, Actual = Red/Orange).
✅ Always add **titles and axis labels** — examiners check this.
✅ Include **legends** for clarity.
✅ Print or export charts as **PDF or image** if required for submission.
✅ Mention that this data is **assumed for academic purpose**.
