## 🧠 **Step 1: Calculate Key EVA Parameters**

| Symbol  | Meaning              | Formula                          | Calculation          | Result      |
| ------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------- |
| **BAC** | Budget at Completion | Total cost                       | 5 × 2,000,000        | ₹10,000,000 |
| **PV**  | Planned Value        | BAC × (Time passed ÷ Total time) | 10,000,000 × (2 ÷ 5) | ₹4,000,000  |
| **EV**  | Earned Value         | Work completed × Cost per stage  | 3 × 2,000,000        | ₹6,000,000  |
| **AC**  | Actual Cost          | Given                            | –                    | ₹8,000,000  |

## 🧮 **Step 2: Compute EVA Metrics**

### 1️⃣ **Cost Performance Index (CPI)**

[
CPI = \frac{EV}{AC} = \frac{6000000}{8000000} = 0.75
]

✅ **CPI = 0.75 → Over Budget**

---

### 2️⃣ **Schedule Performance Index (SPI)**

[
SPI = \frac{EV}{PV} = \frac{6000000}{4000000} = 1.5
]

✅ **SPI = 1.5 → Ahead of Schedule**

---

### 3️⃣ **Estimate at Completion (EAC)**

If both **CPI** and **SPI** affect the outcome:
[
EAC = \frac{BAC}{CPI \times SPI} = \frac{10000000}{(0.75 \times 1.5)} = \frac{10000000}{1.125} = 8,888,888
]

✅ **EAC ≈ ₹8,88,8888 → Expected total cost at completion**

---

### 4️⃣ **Variance at Completion (VAC)**

[
VAC = BAC - EAC = 10000000 - 8888888 = 1,111,112
]

✅ **VAC = +₹1,11,112 → Under Budget (based on forecast)**

---

## 📊 **Step 3: Interpretation**

| Metric            | Result                                                      | Meaning |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| **SPI = 1.5**     | Ahead of schedule — project progressing faster than planned |         |
| **CPI = 0.75**    | Over budget — spending more than planned for work completed |         |
| **EAC = ₹8.89M**  | Estimated cost at completion                                |         |
| **VAC = +₹1.11M** | Will likely save ₹1.11M if performance continues            |         |

✅ **Conclusion:**
The **Solar Power Plant** project is **ahead of schedule** (fast progress), but it’s **cost-inefficient** (spending too much).
With corrective action, it can still finish **slightly under the original budget**.

## 🗣️ **Viva Explanation (Short Answer)**

> “We applied Earned Value Analysis for a Solar Power Plant project with a total budget of ₹1 crore and 5 stages. After 2 months, 3 stages were completed for ₹80 lakh.
> From calculations, SPI = 1.5 (ahead of schedule) and CPI = 0.75 (over budget).
> The estimated cost at completion (EAC) is ₹88.9 lakh, slightly under the budget.
> The line chart shows the comparison of PV, EV, AC, BAC, and EAC.”
